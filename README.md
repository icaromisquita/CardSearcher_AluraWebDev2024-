## Magic: the Gathering Card Searcher

This is a web application designed to search for Magic: the Gathering cards based on user input.  Users can search by:

* Typing a card name, color, or other information in the search bar.
* Clicking on one of the colored mana symbols located above the search bar.

The mana symbols also feature a subtle animation that creates a small circle around the symbol when hovered over.

* Clicking on a mana symbol filters the results to display cards of that color.
